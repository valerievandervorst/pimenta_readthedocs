Installation
------------

Requirements before installing:
 * Miniconda
 * Guppy == 6.5.7 (https://community.nanoporetech.com/downloads)

First clone the pipeline into a chosen directory: ::

   git clone https://github.com/WFSRDataScience/PIMENTA.git


To use PIMENTA, first install by running the install script: ::

   cd pimenta
   bash install.sh

This creates a new conda environment called "pimenta" with all dependencies, except Guppy.
